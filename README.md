### Brief Description and Introduction
* Heart disease prediction using machine learning algorithm.
* It is difficult to identify heart disease because of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholestrol, abnormal pulse rate and many other factors.
* The severity of the heart disease is classified on the Random Forest Classifier.
* The main objective of this web application is to develop a heart prediction system can discover diseases from the heart data set.
* This application aims to implement machine learning techniques on the medical data set to assist in the prediction of the heart disease.
* Backend code respository [link](https://github.com/ganesh-dagadi/hearattackbackend)
* The model is pickled and used using an API developed using flask.
* Postgresql is used to store patients information

## The model has an accuracy of 97%
### Steps of execution of the project
1. Start of the application
2. Input values such as age, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate achieved, etc.
3. Click on the predict button to predict the heart disease. (1 == risk of a heart disease and 0 == safe)
4. close the application.
